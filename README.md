# Laravel User Management with Filters, Pagination & Dependent Dropdown

## 📌 Description
This Laravel project is a **User Management System** where users can be filtered dynamically by **name, age range, division, district, and thana**.  
It also includes **AJAX-based dependent dropdowns**, so selecting a Division automatically loads related Districts, and selecting a District loads related Thanas.  
The results are paginated with **10 users per page**, and filters remain applied while switching between pages.
